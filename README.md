# PlayCore – Game Server Hosting Dashboard

**PlayCore** is a planned frontend application in the **HSWLP ecosystem**,  
focused on providing a **modern, user-friendly interface for game server hosting**.  

The goal is to make it easy for players, communities, and developers to  
launch, manage, and monitor game servers with just a few clicks – all  
powered by Cloudflare’s global, serverless infrastructure.

## ✨ Vision

- 🎮 **Game Hosting** – deploy and run popular game servers (Minecraft, CS, Valheim, etc.)  
- ⚡ **Quick Deploy** – spin up servers in minutes, no manual setup required  
- 📊 **Dashboard** – monitor server performance, players, and logs  
- 🔐 **User Accounts** – authentication, roles, and permissions  
- 💳 **Credit System** – pay-per-use or subscription billing (Stripe integration)  
- 🌐 **Protected Networking** – optional Cloudflare integration for DDoS protection and dynamic ports

## 🛠️ Planned Architecture

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React + TailwindCSS)  
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers (API, auth, billing)  
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (users, servers, usage logs)  
- **Storage:** R2 (configs, backups)  
- **Payments:** Stripe for credits & subscriptions  
- **Integration:** APIs to communicate with server backends (e.g. Docker, Unifi UDM)
